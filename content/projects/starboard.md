*Innovative Hydrofoil Design*
<!--more-->

In collaboration with Martin Fischer and Mathieu Durand, our team worked on designing hydrofoils for windsurfing and wingfoiling. A significant part of our efforts went into developing an optimization tool to create designs that met specific criteria for takeoff, stability, and performance across various speeds.

Our client, Tiesda You, shared his experience with the windfoil in an interview, emphasizing its remarkable efficiency. You can watch the interview below:
