Innovative Hydrofoil Design
<!--more-->


In collaboration with Martin Fischer and Mathieu Durand, our team embarked on designing a series of state-of-the-art hydrofoils tailored for windsurfing and wingfoiling. A pivotal aspect was the development of an automated optimization tool capable of delivering designs that met precise take-off, stability, and performance criteria across varying speeds.

The project's significance is already evident through a compelling interview with Tiesda You, our client. In the interview, Tiesda shares his remarkable experience with the windfoil, highlighting an unprecedented level of efficiency. You can watch the interview below:

Although this project is still in its early phases, the initial feedback is extremely promising. These innovative designs are already pushing the boundaries of hydrofoil performance and reshaping the windsurfing and wingfoiling landscape.
