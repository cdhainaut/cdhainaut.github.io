Yacht design, RANSE simulation
<!--more-->

At the core of the ![Energy Class](https://energyboatchallenge.com/participants/energy-class/) competition by the Monaco Yacht Club lies a distinct challenge â€” optimizing propulsion methods to secure victory in an exciting race.

My role encompassed the engineering of a catamaran, particularly focusing on the hydrodynamic design of its hulls and overall structure. Through RANSE simulations, I analyzed and refined the hull's hydrodynamics to minimize resistance.
