Performance prediction
<!--more-->
Grain de Sail 2 embodies the maritime industry's shift towards sustainable shipping practices. In collaboration with naval architect Loys Leclerc and the [L2O Naval](https://www.l2onaval.com/) team, we had the opportunity to contribute to this important initiative.

Collaborating with Arthur Rozand, our work involved generating a performance polar utilizing VPP (Velocity Prediction Program) tools.
