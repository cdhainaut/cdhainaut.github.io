Performance prediction

In the context of eco-friendly shipping initiatives, Grain de Sail 2 emerges as an endeavor aimed at promoting sustainable practices in maritime transportation. My collaboration with naval architect Loys Leclerc and the [L2O Naval](https://www.l2onaval.com/) team allowed me to contribute to this significant venture.

Working with Arthur Rozand, our work included crafting performance models, notably polar diagrams, to assist in navigation.

I look forward to the positive impact this project will bring to the maritime industry.
