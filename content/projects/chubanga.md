*Olympic Kitefoil Design*
<!--more-->
In collaboration with Simone Bartesaghi of Fluid4Engineering and Luca Filippi of Chubanga, I contributed to the design of the kitefoil for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Our combined efforts yielded a design that athletes could rely on for their Olympic journey.

The kitefoil has since garnered an impressive record, securing multiple gold medals at world championships and establishing itself as a reference in kitefoil racing. Throughout the project, my responsibilities included refining tools to optimize foil profiles along the span and addressing ventilation challenges in the front wing while maintaining overall performance.

As of 2023, the kitefoil remains a standout performer in competitive kitefoil racing, showcasing the continued success of our collaborative design.
