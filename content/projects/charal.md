Performance Prediction, Dynamic Simulation, and Foil Design
<!--more-->

At the beginning of the project in 2021, my work focused primarily on performance prediction and dynamic simulation. I developed a methodology to analyze various designs and settings dynamically, involving the creation of physical models, automation of calculations, optimization of settings, and analysis of extensive data.

In the subsequent phase in 2023, I collaborated with Martin Fischer and Mathieu Durand to design a second set of foils. Working closely with the Charal team, our goal was to address the limitations of the initial version.

The project boasts already has an impressive race record, achieving 3rd place in the Route du Rhum 2022 and 2nd place in the Bermudes 1000 Race.
