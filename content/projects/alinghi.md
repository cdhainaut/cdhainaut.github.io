Performance prediction, Mathematical Modelling
<!--more-->

As part of the early stages of the America's Cup campaign with the Swiss team, I collaborated on developing mathematical and physical models for performance prediction and optimization. 
<!-- Additionally, I applied my expertise in artificial intelligence to create a match racing strategy tool. -->

<!-- My contributions were aimed at enhancing the team's competitive edge through advanced modeling and strategic decision-making. -->
