*Computational Fluid Dynamics*
<!--more-->
In collaboration with [Fluid4Engineering](http://www.fluid4engineering.com/), I undertook various hydrodynamic analysis projects within the maritime industry.

A substantial aspect of my work involved conducting RANSE simulations to predict hull resistance across diverse marine conditions. These simulations significantly contributed to optimizing vessel designs, resulting in notable improvements in hydrodynamic performance.

To streamline and refine the simulation process, I engineered a suite of automation tools using Java and python. These programs not only drastically reduced simulation duration but also ensured consistent and replicable results, enhancing the robustness of our analyses.

Moreover, I developed and implemented specialized tools to automate intricate calculations and shift them to external servers, such as AWS. This strategic approach considerably improved computational efficiency and empowered us to tackle more complex simulation scenarios.
