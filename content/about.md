I'm Charles Dhainaut, a Brest-based freelance engineer specialized in hydrodynamics for race yacht design.

My expertise revolves around optimizing hydrodynamic designs and leveraging numerical simulation to elevate performance across diverse yacht design aspects.

I embrace an 'exploratory design' philosophy, considering optimization as a collaborative, iterative process guided by human intuition. This approach acknowledges the significance of framing precise questions, driving responsive and impactful improvements.

My approach prioritizes a holistic perspective, focusing on the larger picture rather than getting lost in specifics. This comprehensive outlook ensures that every design enhancement contributes cohesively to the overall performance of racing yachts.

With a background in naval architecture, my dedication lies in delivering innovative hydrodynamic solutions that embody these fundamental principles.
