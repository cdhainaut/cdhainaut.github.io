I'm Charles Dhainaut, an independent engineer based in Brest, France. My passion lies in designing hydrodynamic solutions for race yachts. With a background in naval architecture, I specialize in optimizing designs using numerical simulations, data analysis, and machine learning techniques.

I'm particularly intrigued by the exploration and optimization of holistic concepts. In my work, I strive to develop tools that address this challenge, aiming to enhance overall system performance and efficiency.

My recent work includes optimizing hydrodynamic designs for various vessels. I've had the privilege of contributing to projects like foil development for events like the Olympics, or the Vendee Globe challenge.

Feel free to explore my [projects](/projects) and [resume](/cv.pdf) to learn more about my work in hydrodynamics and yacht design. If you'd like to connect, I'd love to chat and explore potential collaborations.
